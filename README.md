# Grades

Create an array called ‘myTestResults’ that stores a list of results out of 100
that you have scored for 5 ﬁctitious tests that you have written in a
ﬁctitious class.

Write the code that will calculate the average grade based on the results
in my ‘ myTestResults’. For example, the average grade based on the values
in the example  above would be:
Average = (40 + 60 + 80 + 80 + 85)/5;
